        "at location $(i,j)$\n",
        "in the input image and hidden representation, respectively.\n",
        "Consequently, to have each of the hidden units\n",
        "receive input from each of the input pixels,\n",
        "we would switch from using weight matrices\n",

To allow every hidden unit (i,j) to depend on every input pixel (k,l), they need a weight for each of those combinations. That gives rise to a 4D weight tensor: $$W_{i,j,k,l}$$ Which means: “the weight from input pixel (k,l) to hidden unit (i,j).” This is before weight sharing—i.e., the unconstrained case, like a spatially-aware fully connected layer. The visualization of this schematic of connection between two matrices are shown below as well as the 4-th order tensor. While 3rd order tensor can be easily imagined as a stack of matrices, 4th order can be thought of as a matrix of matrices.\n",

        "\n",
        "> To **reduce the number of parameters** and exploit spatial **translation invariance**, we assume that instead of using arbitrary weights $\\mathbf{W}_{i,j,k,l}$, we can express: $$k = i + a,\\quad l = j + b$$ So we write: $$\n",

        "\n",
        "In this section we derived the structure of convolutional neural networks from first principles. While it is unclear whether this was the route taken to the invention of CNNs, it is satisfying to know that they are the *right* choice when applying reasonable principles to how image processing and computer vision algorithms should operate, at least at lower levels. In particular, translation invariance in images implies that all patches of an image will be treated in the same manner. Locality means that only a small neighborhood of pixels will be used to compute the corresponding hidden representations. Some of the earliest references to CNNs are in the form of the Neocognitron :cite:`Fukushima.1982`.\n",
        "\n",
        "A second principle that we encountered in our reasoning is how to reduce the number of parameters in a function class without limiting its expressive power, at least, whenever certain assumptions on the model hold. We saw a dramatic reduction of complexity as a result of this restriction, turning computationally and statistically infeasible problems into tractable models.\n",
        "\n",
        "Adding channels allowed us to bring back some of the complexity that was lost due to the restrictions imposed on the convolutional kernel by locality and translation invariance. Note that it is quite natural to add channels other than just red, green, and blue. Many satellite\n",
        "images, in particular for agriculture and meteorology, have tens to hundreds of channels,\n",
        "generating hyperspectral images instead. They report data on many different wavelengths. In the following we will see how to use convolutions effectively to manipulate the dimensionality of the images they operate on, how to move from location-based to channel-based representations, and how to deal with large numbers of categories efficiently.\n",
